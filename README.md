# simple-and-easy-es6-boilerplate
simple and easy boilerplate for using ES6 without any framework or library.

# how to run it?

use:

```
npm install
```

to install all packages and run:

```
npm run start
```

to build the little project and then open the index.html and you'll see it working.


# What's inside?

* babel
* eslint
* jest
* webpack

has a simple little webpack that compiles the code in `src/app.js` and mounts it in the `dist/bundle.js` folder called in the index.html script.

There's also a class es6 that would render a text in the h1 tag of the index.html and a small test with jest that checks that the ExampleClass class is working correctly.
